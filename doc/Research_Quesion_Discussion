Hi Team,

Please add in your suggestions on research questions so that we can decide on the final question for the project.

Rato's Suggestions
------------------
1) Maximization on saving on electricity bill (domestic) / pay-off period
  Solar energy Panel Generation - energy (MJ) by month, postcode / suburb / region
  Normal electricity consumption
  Government installation subsidy (one-off)
  Feed-in tariff
  
2) Is it possible to pay $0 in electricity bill?
  Batteries installation cost
  Energy stored in batter - Amount of energy generated from solar - amount consummed by day

3) How latitude/climate influence solar radiation in Australia?
   based on solar station location/climate data compare with monthly solar exposure
   
Ashley's Suggestions
--------------------
How much solar panels do I need to run my house entirely?

Consumption: need to know what is the unit consumption or average unit consumption in Australia by analyzing the last maybe 3/6 months of the electricity bill, so estimate the system's requirement. (Or we can analysis based on our own figure)
Location: solar productions is depending on the geographic location. Maximun capacity and peak daylight hours.
Panel orientation: it is imperative to have the solar panels angled in the most optimal manner (north-facing) for ensuring peak production on most days.
Quality of solar panel: high/medium/low efficiency panels
