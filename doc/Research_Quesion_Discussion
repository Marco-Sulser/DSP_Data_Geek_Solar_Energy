  Solar energy Panel Generation - energy (MJ) by month, postcode / suburb / region
  Normal electricity consumption
  Government installation subsidy (one-off)
  Feed-in tariff
  
2) Is it possible to pay $0 in electricity bill?
  Batteries installation cost
  Energy stored in batter - Amount of energy generated from solar - amount consummed by day

3) How latitude/climate influence solar radiation in Australia?
